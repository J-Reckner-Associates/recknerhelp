<a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f1');"><b>I am having trouble logging in to a Reckner Healthcare Online Survey</b></a>
<div id="f1" class="faqitem">
	If you received your survey invitation via an email, you may be able to click directly on the link shown in the invitation.  You <u>may</u> be asked to enter a password from the survey invitation which is located below the survey link.  
	If you are not able to click directly on the web link to launch the survey, you can copy and paste the second link from your survey invitation (i.e. http://www.jramednet.com/login.aspx?IID=123456789) into your internet browser's address bar 
	and you should be directed into the survey.  Do not paste the link into a search engine's "search" page.
	<br/><br/>
	If you received a fax survey invitation from us, you should log onto our website <a href="http://www.recknermednet.com" target="_new">www.recknermednet.com</a> and click on the 'Received a Fax' button.  It will then prompt you for your fax 
	code from the survey invitation and your First and Last Name exactly as they appear on the survey invitation.  Please note the fax invitations are meant for the addressed recipient only.
	<br/><br/>
	If you received a fax survey invitation from us, which wasn't addressed to a specific individual, but looking for an office healthcare professional (i.e. RN, NP, Office Manager, ) then you should type the survey invitation link 
	(i.e. http://survey4.reckner.com/XXXXXXXX) directly into your internet browser's address bar.  Do not type it into a search engine's "search" page.  You will then be asked to enter your survey invitation password (located below the survey link 
	in your invitation) to begin.
	<br/><br/>
	Still having problems? Are you able to reach the site and enter a password/login code?
	If you get that far, and after entering a password nothing happens it could be a pop-up blocker.
	Under "options" or "preferences" for your browser, you should be able to find the proper security setting (just remember to turn the pop-up blocker back on after you've completed the survey), or usually a warning button on your browser can be clicked 
	to allow pop-ups from this site (after you reach the page).

<div id="f4" class="faqitem">
	Due to IRS regulations, persons receiving more than $600 in payments in a calendar year from Reckner / J. Reckner Associates, Inc. must receive an IRS Form 1099 - Misc Income. We are required to collect the appropriate information from all respondents 
	completing Surveys to facilitate the processing of 1099 forms. This W-9 data will be collected in a secure web session (SSL) and your Tax Identification Number will be stored in our database in an encrypted form.

	<li><a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f5a');"><b>Survey FAQs</b></a>
	<div id="f5a" class="faqitem">
		<a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f5a1');"><b>Why didn�t I qualify for the survey?</b></a>
		<div id="f5a1" class="faqitem">Qualification criteria varies from survey to survey based upon the overall scope of the research goals. Just because you may not qualify for this study, does not mean you will not qualify for the next.</div>
		<br/>
		<a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f5a2');"><b>How do I check on my payments?</b></a>
		<div id="f5a2" class="faqitem">If you have completed an online self-administered survey and are expecting payment that has not been received in the 4-6 week payment time period you may email Bonnie Thomas (<a href="mailto:bonnie.thomas@reckner.com">
			bonnie.thomas@reckner.com</a>).  Please include your study topic and job/reference number.
			<!--Note � can we make the simple survey form here-->
		</div>
		<br/>
		<a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f5a3');"><b>When can I expect to get paid for a survey I completed?</b></a>
		<div id="f5a3" class="faqitem">All checks are typically mailed out all at once within 4-6 weeks after the completion of each study. So, if you are one of the first to complete a particular project, and that research extends for several weeks, all checks 
			will be mailed out at once 4-6 weeks once the study finishes up.</div>
		<br/>
		<a class="faqlink" onClick="showHide('f5a4');"><b>Why does it say the survey is closed?</b></a>
		<div id="f5a4" class="faqitem">For each online survey we conduct there is a specific amount of respondents and people we are looking for. Sometimes we have more members respond than expected and reach our quota for the study quickly, which will close the 
			survey link. We recommend you try to take the survey as soon as you can after receiving notification.</div>
		<br/>

		<div id="f5a6" class="faqitem">Reckner makes every attempt to keep our panel members active; however, there are no guarantees as to how many surveys and/or focus groups in which you will be asked to participate. Many things factor in to how often our panelists 
			contribute including specific household profiles, the types of surveys, and the type of information our clients need to know. We rotate our panel member list on a regular basis to give all members an equal chance of participation. </div>
